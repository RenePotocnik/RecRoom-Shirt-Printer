# Shirt Printer

This repository is for converting, encoding and importing a PNG image into a RecRoom invention (`Shirt Printer - Dorm`)

If you're experiencing any mayor problems, message me on Discord: [**McRen#2940**](https://discordapp.com/users/236809680947511297/)

## How to use 

> **ONLY 16:9 screen ratio supported**\
> *If you're not sure about your screen ratio, run the script - It'll warn you if your monitor isn't supported*\
> If you really want to import, yet you don't have the acceptable screen ratio, got to `Setting -> System -> Display` 
> and change your `Display resolution` to `1920 x 1080`

Run `Shirt-Printer.py`.

In the newly opened window, open a PNG image you want to print.\
I suggest the image is already converted into a RecRoom color palette 
(Photoshop ACO swatch files are included), and scaled to the appropriate size.\
If the image is not converted it will automatically get converted and dithered.

After the data has been encoded, you will be prompted to import all data to RecRoom.\
